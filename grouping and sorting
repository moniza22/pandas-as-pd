groupby() command helps to group columns of interest in a dataset. we can then further perform different operations on those selected columns.
value_count() is another function of python that lets the user count how many times the unique values appeared.
we can use groupby() instead as well e.g.,
dF.country.valuecount() # count the number of times each unique country appeared in the 'country' column of dataframe dF.
dF.groupby('country').country.count() # groupby() created and sorted the dataframe according to same country. 
                                      # Then we picked the country column and counted how many times each country has appeard by count() command.
groupby() can be used in number of ways to shuffle the data or to sort out our desired data, say we have a dataframe dF that lists the price of 
a products by different companies, its ISBN # and other related information about the products. we need to groupby() according to indivitual product 
and check its lowest price available.
we can use the following command: dF.groupby('product').price.min()
